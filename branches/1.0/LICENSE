  "This License" is what you are reading, right now.

  "This/The Program" is whatever work is licensed under this
license.  You know, the thing you downloaded/copied.

  "Modify" is a fancy way of saying "change". This is the thing
you are not going to do unless you want to piss off the
platypus or speak to the aforementioned lawyers.

  "Source code" is the non-compiled form of the program.  

  "Piss off" is to anger one in a pretty big way.

  "Lawyers" are highly trained, highly motivated individuals
that ensure that if you do violate the terms of this license,
you won't do so again.
